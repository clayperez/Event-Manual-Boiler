## PARTNERSHIPS


####Existing Partners
Leverage all existing partnerships for production cash and swag. Bike Monkey events can be tagged on as additional opportunities included in LGF or exclusive opportunities with a cash component. eg. Lagunitas can tag on with beer, or have exclusive rights with cash to keep Anderson Valley out.

####Potential / Leads
#####Anderson Valley Brewery
We have a formal relationship with Lagunitas via Levi's GranFondo sponsorship. However Booneville hosts Anderson Valley Brewery and they should be approached with these considerations as a potential sponsor of the event.

#####Jeff Malnick
Jeff Malnick, a friend of Kris and Angel is a Booneville native who has laid some groundwork for potential sponsors. Carlos to speak with him [DAPULSE].

#####Anderson Valley / Mendocino County
Approach Anderson Valley communities, chamber of commerce, tourism bureau and county district offices to describe the opportunity we are bringing in a typically low-traffic season. See what interest they have in the event, and how they might want to leverage this audience. Create a partnership proposal where they provide resources and/or cash in exchange for us activating our audience on their behalf. eg: VIP package that includes entry to ancillary events or businesses in the region to our racers in exchange for a cash sponsorship.

**See [Partnerships](/partnerships.md) for more detail.**

### Charity

We don't currently have a charitable component to the event. However we should be prepared to make a donation to the junior high school in exchange for venue.

We will use REMBA to start the process. As we develop the event, if another local charity comes to fruition we can consider working with them for local value and still leverage REMBA for the technical aspects of producing the ride. We should turn to REMBA as their "landlord" in exchange for this kind of technical _fiscal sponsorship_ of all our events so permits and ABC licenses are straightforward. The actualy financially benefitting charity could be different, and REMBA can hang their hat on that along with us.

**See [Charity](/charity.md) for more detail.**

### Sponsorships

    Narrate the integration of sponsors, the opportunities that
    exist and what conflicts should be avoided.

**See [Sponsorship](/sponsorship.md) for more detail.**

### Finances

There are no extenuating financial obligations to other organizations at this point. The event is a Bike Monkey event and we will manage the finances in-house, independently.

**See [Budget](/budget.md) for more detail.**
