## PARTNERSHIPS

####Existing Partners
Leverage all existing partnerships for production cash and swag. Bike Monkey events can be tagged on as additional opportunities included in LGF or exclusive opportunities with a cash component. eg. Lagunitas can tag on with beer, or have exclusive rights with cash to keep Anderson Valley out.

####Anderson Valley Brewery
We have a formal relationship with Lagunitas via Levi's GranFondo sponsorship. However Booneville hosts Anderson Valley Brewery and they should be approached with these considerations as a potential sponsor of the event.

####Jeff Malnick
Jeff Malnick, a friend of Kris and Angel is a Booneville native who has laid some groundwork for potential sponsors. Carlos to speak with him [DAPULSE].

####Booneville
Booneville should be approached for potential partnership.
