# Narrative

Use this section to describe the overview of the event. Here is where we capture crucial details about the vision and scale.

## Internal Narrative

The Fish Rock Road Rally event is an adventure road and gravel race in Booneville, CA. It is Bike Monkey's foray into gravel grinders but is only about 1/3 dirt. It's highly challenging but beautiful and in a part of California that is seldom frequented by avid cyclists. Thus, it's a unique event on the calendar.


## One-Liners / Elevator Pitch

A challenging and competitive adventure ride suitable for cross bikes in a remote part of Northern California on beautiful, low-traffic roads.
