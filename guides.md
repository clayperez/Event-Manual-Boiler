# PRODUCTION GUIDES

This section contains guides that will be developed through the course of the first event year's production. On subsequent years these production guides serve as the answer to the way forward in production, and will be modified as necessary.

**Production guides serve two purposes:**

1. As an exercise that needs to be done during the production process to strengthen our knowledge of the work.
1. As a procedural guide for subsequent years of project operation.

**Guide Ownership**

The owner of each guide is the person or persons responsible for the corresponding area of management defined in [Roles and Areas](/roles-and-areas.md).
